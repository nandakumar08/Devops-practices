Planning & Coding: This involves defining project requirements, writing code, and adhering to version control practices.
Continuous Integration (CI): Code changes are frequently merged into a central repository, where automated builds and tests are triggered to identify errors early on.
Continuous Testing (CT): Throughout the development process, automated and manual tests ensure the software functions as intended.
Continuous Delivery/Deployment (CD): Changes are automatically packaged and deployed to testing or production environments, enabling faster releases.
Monitoring & Feedback: Performance and user feedback are continuously monitored to identify issues and areas for improvement.
